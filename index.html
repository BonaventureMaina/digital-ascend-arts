        <p>Ascending Through Art</p>

        <p>
          A global arts production company focused on physical theatre and
          movement-based performance.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="about">
        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
          Digital Ascend Arts Production is an independent arts production company
          dedicated to the creation of original physical theatre and contemporary
          performance work.
        </p>

        <p>
          We operate as an umbrella platform for artistic exploration, allowing
          projects to evolve organically while maintaining a clear commitment to
          craft, discipline, and conceptual depth.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="philosophy">
        <h2>Artistic Philosophy</h2>

        <p>
          We believe the body is a primary site of meaning. Movement, presence,
          and spatial awareness are not decorative elements, but fundamental
          tools for storytelling and inquiry.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our work prioritizes clarity of intention, embodied intelligence, and
          rigorous process. We value exploration over spectacle and depth over
          excess.
        </p>

      <section id="founder">
        <h2>Founder</h2>

        <p>
          Digital Ascend Arts Production was founded by <strong>Bonaventure Maina</strong>,
          a technologist and creative practitioner with a strong interest in the
          intersection of systems thinking, embodiment, and artistic process.
        </p>

        <p>
          The company emerged from a desire to build a disciplined yet flexible
          platform for physical theatre and contemporary performance—one that
          supports long-term artistic growth rather than short-term output.
        </p>
